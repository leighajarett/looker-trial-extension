                  The blue wildebeest, also called the common wildebeest, white-bearded
                  wildebeest or brindled gnu, is a large antelope and one of the two
                  species of wildebeest. It is placed in the genus Connochaetes and family
                  Bovidae and has a close taxonomic relationship with the black
                  wildebeest. The blue wildebeest is known to have five subspecies. This
                  broad-shouldered antelope has a muscular, front-heavy appearance, with a
                  distinctive robust muzzle. Young blue wildebeest are born tawny brown,
                  and begin to take on their adult colouration at the age of two months.
                  The adults' hues range from a deep slate or bluish gray to light gray or
                  even grayish brown. Both sexes possess a pair of large curved horns.
